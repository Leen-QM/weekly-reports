week 1: Survey Data Analysis
this week was focused on collecting visitor survey data,cleaning it up, and exploring insights.
My goal for the week was to successfully complete a set of tasks related to survey data collection, data cleaning, and basic analysis using Power BI and Excel.

At the start of the week, I began by filling out 10 visitor surveys based on different visitor profiles. This was crucial for ensuring that the data represented a diverse set of responses.
The survey was structured to gather feedback on various aspects of the visitor experience, such as satisfaction and preferences regarding Multimedia used in the museum .
Once I had collected the survey results through Microsoft Forms, I downloaded the raw data. The first challenge I faced was cleaning the data. 
There were a few enteries that needed to be unpivoted to simplify the process of creating visuals in Power BI. I used Excel to manually clean up the data.

In the next step, I exported the cleaned data into Power BI to create the dashboard. 
I started with simple data aggregation and visualization tasks. Such as gender, age, and motivation behind their visit.
**I created a few bar charts to visualize the distribution of visitor satisfaction scores and to understand common themes in the open-ended feedback.


Learnings and Insights:
One of the most important things I learned this week was the value of data cleaning. I had assumed that data from a survey would be relatively clean, but I quickly realized that inconsistencies are common, 
especially when the data is entered manually. 
I also learned the importance of choosing the right tool for each task. While Excel was great for cleaning up the data, Power BI allowed me to efficiently visualize the data which helped me identify patterns that might not have been obvious from the raw data alone.
